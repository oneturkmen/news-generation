president trump used his first full day in office on saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media  falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd in a visit to the central intelligence agency intended to showcase his support for the intelligence community  mr trump ignored his own repeated public statements criticizing the intelligence community  a group he compared to nazis just over a week ago he also called journalists among the most dishonest human beings on earth  and he said that up to 1 5 million people had attended his inauguration  a claim that photographs disproved later  at the white house  he dispatched sean spicer  the press secretary  to the briefing room in the west wing  where mr spicer scolded reporters and made a series of false statements he said news organizations had deliberately misstated the size of the crowd at mr trumps inauguration on friday in an attempt to sow divisions at a time when mr trump was trying to unify the country  warning that the new administration would hold them to account the statements from the new president and his spokesman came as hundreds of thousands of people protested against mr trump  a crowd that appeared to dwarf the one that gathered the day before when he was sworn in it was a striking display of invective and grievance at the dawn of a presidency  usually a time when the white house works to set a tone of national unity and to build confidence in a new leader instead  the president and his team appeared embattled and defensive  signaling that the pugnacious style mr trump employed as a candidate will persist now that he has ascended to the nations highest office saturday was supposed to be a day for mr trump to mend fences with the intelligence community  with an appearance at the c i a s headquarters in langley  va while he was lavish in his praise  the president focused in his  speech on his complaints about news coverage of his criticism of the nations spy agencies  and meandered to other topics  including the crowd size at his inauguration  his level of political support  his mental age and his intellectual heft i just want to let you know  i am so behind you  mr trump told more than 300 employees assembled in the lobby for his remarks in recent weeks  mr trump has questioned the intelligence agencies conclusion that russia meddled in the united states election on his behalf after the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about mr trump  he accused the intelligence community of allowing the leak and wrote on twitter  are we living in nazi germany on saturday  he said journalists were responsible for any suggestion that he was not fully supportive of intelligence agencies work i have a running war with the media  mr trump said they are among the most dishonest human beings on earth  and they sort of made it sound like i had a feud with the intelligence community  the reason youre the no 1 stop is  it is exactly the opposite  mr trump added i love you  i respect you  theres nobody i respect more  mr trump also took issue with news reports about the number of people who attended his inauguration  complaining that the news media used photographs of an empty field to make it seem as if his inauguration did not draw many people we caught them in a beauty  mr trump said of the news media  and i think theyre going to pay a big price  mr spicer said that mr trump had drawn the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration  a statement that photographs clearly show to be false mr spicer said photographs of the inaugural ceremonies were deliberately framed to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the national mall  although he provided no proof of either assertion photographs of barack obamas inauguration in 2009 and of mr trumps plainly showed that the crowd on friday was significantly smaller  but mr spicer attributed that disparity to new white ground coverings he said had caused empty areas to stand out and to security measures that had blocked people from entering the mall these attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong  mr spicer said he also admonished a journalist for erroneously reporting on friday that mr trump had removed a bust of the rev dr martin luther king jr from the oval office  calling the mistake  which was corrected quickly  egregious  and he incorrectly claimed that ridership on washingtons subway system was higher than on inauguration day in 2013 in reality  there were 782  000 riders that year  compared with 571  000 riders this year  according to figures from the  transit authority mr spicer also said that security measures had been extended farther down the national mall this year  preventing hundreds of thousands of people from viewing the ceremony but the secret service said the measures were largely unchanged this year  and there were few reports of long lines or delays commentary about the size of his inauguration crowd made mr trump increasingly angry on friday  according to several people familiar with his thinking on saturday  mr trump told his advisers that he wanted to push back hard on dishonest media coverage  mostly referring to a twitter post from a new york times reporter showing  frames of mr trumps crowd and mr obamas in 2009 but most of mr trumps advisers urged him to focus on the responsibilities of his office during his first full day as president however  in his remarks at the c i a he wandered off topic several times  at various points telling the crowd he felt no older than 39  he is 70  reassuring anyone who questioned his intelligence by saying  im  like  a smart person and musing out loud about how many intelligence workers backed his candidacy probably almost everybody in this room voted for me  but i will not ask you to raise your hands if you did  mr trump said were all on the same wavelength  folks  but most of his remarks were devoted to attacking the news media and mr spicer picked up the theme later in the day in the white house briefing room but his appearance  according to the people familiar with mr trumps thinking  went too far  in the presidents opinion mr trumps appearance at the c i a touched off a fierce reaction from some current and former intelligence officials nick shapiro  who served as chief of staff to john o brennan  who resigned friday as the c i a director  said mr brennan is deeply saddened and angered at donald trumps despicable display of  in front of c i a s memorial wall of agency heroes brennan says that trump should be ashamed of himself  mr shapiro added i was heartened that the president gave a speech at c i a   said michael v hayden  a former director of the c i a and the national security agency it would have been even better if more of it had been about c i a  representative adam b schiff of california  the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee  said that he had had high hopes for mr trumps visit as a step to begin healing the relationship between the president and the intelligence community  but that mr trumps meandering speech had dashed them while standing in front of the stars representing c i a personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country  hallowed ground  trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice  mr schiff said he will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world  mr trump said nothing during the visit about how he had mocked the c i a and other intelligence agencies as the same people that said saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction  he did not mention his apparent willingness to believe julian assange  the founder of wikileaks  who is widely detested at the c i a over his own intelligence agencies he also did not say whether he would start receiving the daily intelligence briefs that are prepared for the president the agency sees the president as its main audience  and his dismissal of the need for daily briefings from the intelligence community has raised concerns about morale among people who believe their work will not be respected at the white house since the election  hopes at the c i a that the new administration would bring an infusion of energy and ideas have given way to trepidation about what mr trump and his loyalists have planned but the nomination of mike pompeo  a former army infantry officer who is well versed in issues facing the intelligence community  to lead the c i a has been received positively at the agency he has left the strong impression that he doesnt trust the intelligence community and that he doesnt have tremendous regard for their work  mark m lowenthal  a retired c i a analyst  said of mr trump the obvious thing to do is to counter that by saying  i value you i look forward to working with you  he called them nazis  mr lowenthal added  referring to mr trumps characterization of the intelligence community mr lowenthal said saturdays visit should have been a stroking expedition
